                        Very difficult hike with at least two days expected to reach the top.
                        I hiked when I was in middle school with my dad, and this was my first
                        time spending the night on the mountain.<img src="images/seorak.webp" />`;

                        The tallest mountain in South Korea located at Jeju island.
                        For me, the most fascinating part of hiking this mountain
                        is that as the elevation changes, you can see the vegetation changing drastically.
                        The cover photo has also been taken here.<img src="images/halla.jpg" />`;

                        This is closer to a mountain range than a single mountain, and hikers often
                        follow the trail along this mountain range, usually over three nights. I
                        found this hike to be the most physically demanding as the trail randomly changes between steep incline
                        and down hills.<img src="images/jiri.jpg" />`;

                        I personally have the most memory here because not only is this our family's favorite  
                        camping spot but also it has one of the most gentle trails so all of our family can enjoy 
                        hiking here as we talk along the way. <img src="images/sobaeksan.jpg" />`;

                        This is the closest mountain located at the border of Seoul and Gyungido.
                        Due to its accessibility, we often visit here whenever we are tired of 
                        Seoul's intensive pollution. However, since this mountain is closer to soil-based, rather
                        than rock-based, the surface becomes very muddy during the monsoon season. <img src="images/cheonggyesan.jpeg" />`;

                        This mountain is located at downtown Seoul, within the perimeter of the blue house
                        where it used to be the presidential office. With its relatively gentle slope, it attracts
                        a lot of high school field trips and casual hikers. As you walk along, you can see the skyline of 
                        Seoul and Han river as it divides the city across. <img src="images/inwangsan.jpg" />`;

                        I hiked this mountain when our family toured around the end of Korean peninsula. 
                        While its elevation is lower than its counterparts I hiked, the trail is extremely
                        rocky and steep. It is famous for cloud bridge that also scared me a lot. <img src="images/wolchulsan.jpg" />`;

                        Whenever out family visits Pyeongchang, we always visit this mountain for its cedar-tree trail that walks 
                        along the narrow river coming down from the mountain. Not only is it tranquil but, especially at winter when trees 
                        are covered in snow, the scenery is surreal. <img src="images/odaesan.jpg" />`;
