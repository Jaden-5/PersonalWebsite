                <div class="edu-col">
                    <p>Singapre. Shanghai. Korea. Before coming to college, I attended six different schools in 
                        three different countries while swerving between four different 
                        national curriculums.<br> With my diverse educational background, I 
                        took advantage of every moment that each opportunity provided 
                        through opening up to unique student cultures and challenges.<br> 
                        Such a dynamic experience across many countries has shaped me 
                        as an individual who is not afraid to dip my toes in a new setting 
                        and see what the next<br> opportunity has to offer, knowing that I 
                        will mold and change to become more aware of the world around me.</p>
